## Vision

A decentralized community to support global hackathons on meaningful technical problems and innovations.

## Mission

To financially and operationally support and free global hackers and hackathon organizers (especially open-source repo maintainers) and let them focus on the real valuable technical issues and improvements.

## Why Hackathon? Why DAO?

Ever since the first wave of hackathons in 2010, hackathon has undoubtedly proven its capability of boosting innovation and cooperation. 

- **‚öôÔ∏èTo Build** - We see a lot of brilliant ideas and prototypes being developed yet later grow into valuable products, companies and/or technologies in areas like cyber security contests, Internet industry, Web 3.0 applications and so on.
- **üì¢To communicate** - For those innovative and passionate participants with solid technical skills, hackathons provide them great opportunities to demonstrate their capabilities and projects, exchange ideas, make friends and find partners.

However, big companies dominated hackathons and the hacker movement in recent years and the voices of grass-root hackers are becoming a comparablely small minority now. Through a decentralized organization of hackers with great technical skills and vision, we want to democratize the hacker movement again, where

- hackers themselves can propose and decide what is actually the problems to solve.
- hackers can connect with and inspire each other.
- hackers‚Äò valuable contribution can get proper supports both financially and operationally.

## Products

- Hackathon Open Book - a Github Repo
- Gov Forum + snapshot voting - HackerLink BUIDL
- Community Discussion - Discord
- Hackathon List - HackerLink Hackathon

## **Governance Overview**

Address: 0xFD9F97126EF903872fe96eDE82915f2F2B183da6

Hackathon DAO's governance mechanism will revolve around 1) **hackathon grant rules** and 2)**community operation**(on discord). And, with the goal to boost more valuable technical innovations, the mechanism design of Hackathon DAO will try to make sure:

- the DAO is open for any proposals, yet the community members will vote on whether to approve or reject these proposals.
- the DAO decision represents the will of the community and is controlled by the community.
- the core decision makers in the community are with great tech visions and solid skills.
- the fund and resources mainly go to hackers that make true contribution.

### **1. Hackathon Grant Rules**

Our grant will be happening on a quarterly basis and each grant program will last for 3 months. You can see an example timeline for the upcoming 2022Q1 grant.  

| Step        | Start Date  | End Date    | What will be happening                                           |

Currently, Hackathon DAO will be focusing on three main areas: Web3, Cryptography(ZK) and Quantum Computing(open-source tool and crypto crossover), and we will gradually get more topics involved if we have more credential members from more technical fields in our community. 

### 1.1 Hackathon Application

A Hackathon proposal needs to be submitted as a BUIDL on HackerLink with all information properly filled. Any hackathon meets the following standards are more than welcomed to apply: 

- The organizer or the organizing team is a maintainer of an active Github repo.
- The organizer or one of the organizing team members has passed Hackathon DAO KYC.
- None of the organizing team is not on the blacklist of Hackathon DAO.
- Hackathon must have a clear and specific problem to solve instead of aimlessly exploring.
- Hackathon must have a budget plan if the grant will be used for anything other than bonus.
- Hackathon needs to be organized ONLY through HackerLink platform using its bounty or hackathon feature.
- Hackathon must happen during the season hacking time window according to the posted agenda.

### 1.2. Hackathon Vote

For each season, we will hold a grant for each focus area with an independent funding pool each. The token holders can vote for their preferred hackathon using quadratic voting. All the hackathon proposal will be ranked descending according to the vote and hackathon proposals will be supported according to the rank until no enough funding is available.

>In short term, the voting will be happening offline within all voting token holders.

### 1.3. Hackathon Grant Issue

All the grant will be issued after the hackathon and before the end of the grant season according to calendar date. For different applicants and different uses of funds, we will have different process:

- **Organizer on Hackathon DAO whitelist** - all fund issue directly
- **Organizer on Hackathon DAO blacklist** - no fund will be issued
- **Organizer neither on whitelist or blacklist** - fund that used for hackathon bonus will be issued after the organizer updating their BUIDL page with the latest updates and getting at least one DAO staff's review. Other logistic cost will be released using reimbursement mode.

### 1.4. Hackathon DAO Seasonal Faire - Public Vote

We will hold an public vote using quadratic voting with XXX USDT grant from Hackathon DAO for all the projects submitted from this season‚Äôs hackathons, where everyone (in or outside the Hackathon DAO) can vote and show their supports.

- The bonus received will directly go to the hackers themselves.
- The votes obtained of one hacker/team will be converted into Hackathon DAO credits (HCs) one-to-one.

### 1.5. Hackathon Review

By the end of each season, we will have all the supported hackathons evaluated according to their hacking experience, outcome quality and owner's organizing skills.

All the hackathon organizers will be asked to update their origin application BUIDL page with the latest progress, so that the DAO workers and all the participated hackers of the season can vote according to their preference with more context.

- **workers votes** (DAO admin and staffs) - each DAO worker will get N votes where N equals to the amount of this seasons' supported hackathons.
- **Hackers votes** (all hackathon participants) - each hacker will get vote(s) according to the number of hackathon he/she participated in the season. One hackathon, one vote.

The final results will be the sum of **workers‚Äò votes**, **hackers votes** and **public votes** and will have the following impacts: 

- The votes obtained of one organizer will be converted into Hackathon DAO credits (HCs) one-to-one.
- The organizer that gets both the highest workers' votes, hackers' votes or public votes will be added into the Hackathon DAO whitelist for the next season and removed from blacklist if exists. If there's a tie for first place, all the winning organizers will be added to the whitelist.
- The organizer that violates the community rules and gets reported by more than two DAO worker or hackers will be added into Hackathon DAO blacklist for the next season and removed from whitelist if exists.

> public votes = the total votes gained of all the submitted projects in the seasonal DAO public vote
