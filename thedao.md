## Vision

A decentralized community to support global hackathons on meaningful technical problems and innovations.

## Mission

To financially and operationally support and free global hackers and hackathon organizers (especially open-source repo maintainers) and let them focus on the real valuable technical issues and improvements.

## Why Hackathon? Why DAO?

Ever since the first wave of hackathons in 2010, hackathon has undoubtedly proven its capability of boosting innovation and cooperation. 

- **‚öôÔ∏èTo Build** - We see a lot of brilliant ideas and prototypes being developed yet later grow into valuable products, companies and/or technologies in areas like cyber security contests, Internet industry, Web 3.0 applications and so on.
- **üì¢To communicate** - For innovative and passionate participants with solid technical skills, hackathons provide them great opportunities to demonstrate their capabilities and projects, exchange ideas, make friends and find partners.

However, big companies dominated hackathons and the hacker movement in recent years and the voices of grass-root hackers are becoming a small minority now. Through a decentralized organization of hackers with great technical skills and vision, we want to democratize the hacker movement again, where

- hackers themselves can propose and decide what is actually the problems to solve.
- hackers can connect with and inspire each other.
- hackers‚Äò valuable contribution can get proper supports both financially and operationally.

## Products

- Hackathon Open Book - Github Repo
- Gov Forum + snapshot voting - HackerLink BUIDL
- Community Discussion - Discord
- Hackathon List - HackerLink Hackathon

## **Governance Overview**

Âú∞ÂùÄ TBD

Hackathon DAO's governance mechanism will revolve around 1) **hackathon grant rules** and 2)**community operation**(on discord). And, with the goal to boost more valuable technical innovations, the mechanism design of Hackathon DAO will try to make sure:

- the DAO is open for any proposals, yet the community members will vote on whether to approve or reject these proposals.
- the DAO decision represents the will of the community and is controlled by the community.
- the core decision makers in the community are with great tech visions and solid skills.
- the fund and resources mainly go to hackers that make true contribution.

### **1. Hackathon Grant Rules**

Our grant will be happening on a quarterly basis and each grant program will last for 3 months. You can see an example timeline for the upcoming 2022Q1 grant.  

| Step        | Start Date  | End Date    | What will be happening                                           |

Currently, Hackathon DAO will be focusing on three main areas: Web3, Cryptography(ZK) and Quantum Computing(open-source tool and crypto crossover), and we will gradually get more topics involved if we have more credential members from more technical fields in our community. 

### 1.1 Hackathon Application

A Hackathon proposal needs to be submitted as a BUIDL on HackerLink with all information properly filled. Any hackathon meets the following standards are more than welcomed to apply: 

- The organizer or the organizing team is a maintainer of an active Github repo.
- The organizer or one of the organizing team members has passed Hackathon DAO KYC.
- None of the organizing team is not on the blacklist of Hackathon DAO.
- Hackathon must have a clear and specific problem to solve instead of aimlessly exploring.
- Hackathon must have a budget plan if the grant will be used for anything other than bonus.
- Hackathon needs to be organized ONLY through HackerLink platform using its bounty or hackathon feature.
- Hackathon must happen during the season hacking time window.

### 1.2. Hackathon Vote

For each season, we will hold a grant for each focus area with an independent funding pool each. The token holders can vote for their preferred hackathon using quadratic voting. All the hackathon proposal will be ranked descending according to the vote and hackathon proposals will be supported according to the rank until no enough funding is available.

In short term, the voting will be happening offline within all voting token holders.

### 1.3. Hackathon Grant Issue

All the grant will be issued after the hackathon and before the end of the grant season according to calendar date. For different applicants and different uses of funds, we will have different process:

- **Organizer on Hackathon DAO whitelist** - all fund issue directly
- **Organizer on Hackathon DAO blacklist** - no fund will be issued
- **Organizer neither on whitelist or blacklist** - fund that used for hackathon bonus will be issued after the organizer updating their BUIDL page with the latest updates and getting at least one DAO steward's review. Other logistic cost will be released using reimbursement mode.

### 1.4. Hackathon Review

By the end of each season, we will ask all the hackathon organizers to update their origin BUIDL page with the latest progress. After that, the DAO token holders and all the hackathon participants of the season will vote for all the DAO supported hackathons together. The votes will be calculated into **workers votes** (from DAO admin and stewards) and **developer votes** (from all participants). 

The final results will have the following impacts:  

- The votes obtained of one organizer will be converted into Hackathon DAO credits one-to-one. These credits can help the voters to evaluate in future seasons and can be exchanged into DAO tokens under a one-to-X ratio.
- The organizer that gets the highest workers' votes or developers' votes will be added into the Hackathon DAO whitelist for the next season and removed from blacklist if exists. If there's a tie for the first place, all the winning organizers will be added to the whitelist.

Besides, we will hold an open vote using quadratic voting for all the projects from this season's hackathons, where anyone (in or outside the Hackathon DAO) can show their preference. 

- The bonus received will directly go to the hackers themselves. 
- The votes obtained of one hacker/team will be converted into Hackathon DAO credits one-to-one. These credits can help the voters to evaluate in future seasons and can be exchanged into DAO tokens under a one-to-X ratio.

## Additional Notes

### **1. Notes**

1. Hackathon DAO funds will be used ONLY to support hackathons and will not be used for product developing, community operation or steward salary. 
2. All the cost other than hackathons grants will be supported by DoraHacks.
3. The governance of DAO does not involve the election of any DAO members. Steward is directly delegated and managed by DoraHacks, but it needs to be managed in accordance with DAO's governance rules.
4. The funding of Hackathon DAO is completed by Hackathon DAO in the multi-signature wallet of Gnosis SAFE, and the multi-signature wallet is fully controlled by the results of community governance.
5. The current governance rules do not require the use of Snapshot and non-HackerLink voting tools.
6. Other possible governance rules in the future: For a single Hackathon Grant funding, use Futarchy for community voting. These governance rules are currently not considered.
