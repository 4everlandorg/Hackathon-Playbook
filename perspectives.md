### What is a hackathon
A Hackathon is an event where people(mostly hackers) gather together to intensively 'hack' on certain topics under time constraints, where the final projects are not necessarily refined and concept-proving prototypes are totally acceptable. As a mean of inspiration and innovation, a hackathon is very flexible and almost everything can be the topic and we have seen lots of great hacks in developer communities, schools and companies, like:

- **technical** hacks on blockchain, cyber security, IOT, Web 3.0, repo bug fixing, ect;
- **cross-disciplined** hacks on wearable devices, art installations, rural education, ect;
- **fun** hacks on Halloween, Mario games, ect;


### The Goal of a Hackathon

With the flexibility of hackathons, the goal of a specific hackathon can be quite diversified. However, since the first wave of hackathons in 2010, it has undoubtedly proven its capability of boosting innovation and cooperation. 

- **‚öôÔ∏èTo Build** - We see a lot of brilliant ideas and prototypes being developed yet later grow into valuable products, companies and/or technologies in areas like cyber security contests, Web 3.0 applications and so on. 

- **üì¢To communicate** - For innovative and passionate participants with solid technical skills, hackathons will provide them great opportunities to demonstrate their capabilities and projects, exchange ideas, make friends and find partners.
