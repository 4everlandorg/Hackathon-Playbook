Hackathon DAO is a decentralized community to support global hackathons on meaningful technical problems and innovations. 

To financially and operationally support and liberate global hackers and hackathon organizers (especially open-source repo maintainers) and focus on truly valuable technical problems and improvements, we 
- Hold seasonal grants to fund meaningful hackathons. 
- Maintain a hackathon openbook to share (almost) everything about hackathons.
- Organize an online community of top hackers and hackathon organizers to actively discuss the (most) valuable tech problems and innovations.

## How to Join
A community canâ€™t be driven without a shared common vision. At Hackathon DAO, we want to gather a group of enthusiastic hackers with great technical skills and vision to boost the hacker movement to another level, where
- Hackers themselves can propose and decide what are the real problems to solve.
- Hackers can connect with and inspire each other.
- Valuable contributions will be supported financially and operationally.

Please do join us if you share the same belief with us!!!
